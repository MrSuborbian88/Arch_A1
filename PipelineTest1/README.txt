This is just a silly, alternate implementation that I was working on when trying to figure out what the code was supposed to be doing. I tend to find I need to do stuff like this to understand code provided. It probably won't be helpful to anyone except my brain. Much credit goes to my friend Mike, who patiently answered far more questions about java and Eclipse than he should have. 

Also, it was working but now appears to be somewhat working. How thrilling. The adventure continues.
